# Dataproject
## Problem statement
Today's world is increasingly revolving around the healthy lifestyle social media and society is advertising for. However many false or unfair claims are made about the contents of certain fruits or vegetables. Superfruits do not exist, and if they do, they are not the fruits that people currently consider to be superfood. But what if there was a website on which you could see all the fruits and their nutritional values?

## Solution
I will visualize the nutritional values of fruits for every nutrient that is present and make it possible to visually compare fruits head to head against each other. 

### Sketches

Current progress: PLEASE MIND: when selecting the first figure, please select the second dropdown first if you want a double "web" to be drawn into the svg. I will fix this later on!

### Main features - MVP
The main features of this data project will be the ability to compare the micro nutrients head to head for each fruit by means of a bar chart. 
### Main features - optional
On top of that I want to get an average percentage of to what extent 100 grams of each fruit satisfies your daily needs in terms of all nutrients present in fruit. This will identify the "real" superfruits if they are out there. If there is time left, I also want to make some kind of indication of the carbon food print (for all the vegan hippies out there). I currently have the idea to do this based on location. You enter your country and the distance between you and the place where the fruit is grown will determine the eco-friendliness of the fruit. I would also like to incorporate a nutrient-to-calorie ratio, as some fruits are very nutritious but also very high on sugar. 

## Prerequisites
### Data sources
https://www.fda.gov/Food/LabelingNutrition/ucm063482.htm
https://www.nutrition-and-you.com/fruit-nutrition.html
https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/nutrients/index
### External components
Probably I will not need any external components, as I will store all my data in csv's. The nutritional value of fruit doesnt change overnight. 
### Similar visualizations
All visualizations one can find online are not extensive, or text only. Just numbers are very hard to compare in large quantities. 
### Pitfalls
The most difficult part will be collecting all the data effectively
